# Shallot - An Onion Routing Library

---

## Intro

This project will is an assignment for IDATT2104 - Nettverksprogrammering
The assignment is to implement **onion routing** either as software or as a library. 
We are free to use any programming language, but C++ or Rust implementations are more desired. Even though I would really like to learn more C++, given the complexity of the task I chose to use Java, as it is what I'm most comfortable with.

I have created a list of goals I can strive for. The point is not to complete all the goals, but to give a path to follow and give a indication of the priority of features.


### Goals:
	- [] Setup client and server
	- [] Encrypt messages between them
	- [] Create node than can add and peel layers from a TCP payload
	- [] Route through 3 nodes such that the route is anonymus
	- [] Automatically distribute nodes when a request is made
	- [] More to come...
